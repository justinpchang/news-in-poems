In 2023, the books are here to shine,<br>To captivate children's hearts, oh so divine.<br>With words and pictures, they tell tales,<br>That leave us longing for more, as their magic prevails.<br><br>"Do You Remember?" by Sydney Smith,<br>A story that will surely uplift,<br>A boy and his mother, snuggled in bed,<br>Their memories traded, as hope is spread.<br><br>In their new apartment, fear is quelled,<br>As they share the life they once held.<br>Through watercolor and gouache divine,<br>The illustrations tell a tale, so fine.<br><br>From full-page views of son and mother,<br>To fragments of memories, like a cover,<br>Snapshots in an album, a scrapbook of minds,<br>A journey through time, where love binds.<br><br>With each turn of the page, a feeling evoked,<br>Resilience, love, and hope invoked.<br>A tender reminder of what we have lost,<br>And the strength to move forward, no matter the cost.<br><br>So let's dive in, oh little ones so dear,<br>To the best books of 2023, with no fear.<br>Immerse yourselves in tales of wonder,<br>And let your imagination thunder.<br><br>For as the pages turn, and stories unfold,<br>May you find a world worth more than gold.<br>With every line, may your dreams take flight,<br>As you fill your minds with pure delight.
