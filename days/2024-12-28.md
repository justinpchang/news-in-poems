Mornings start anew,  <br>Beans of rich delight  <br>Rise from earth's warm embrace.  <br>A costly cup unfolds.  <br><br>Rainforest whispers,  <br>Lost in the brew's dark dance,  <br>Echoes of scarcity.  <br>Resilience in a bean.  <br><br>Heat waves scorch the lands,  <br>Roasting beans in protest,  <br>Yet still, the world craves  <br>The bittersweet elixir.  <br><br>Farmers toil with care,  <br>Dreaming of a verdant sea,  <br>Coffee's essence blooms  <br>In each fragrant sip.
