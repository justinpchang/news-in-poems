In Richmond, where skies are blue and grand,<br>The council faced a rowdy stand,<br>Residents cried, "Drug sites? Not in our nest!"<br>Tumult and tension put their city to the test.<br><br>The mayor, stalwart, tried to steer the way,<br>Amidst the chaos, would words sway?<br>But citizens, emotions raw and high,<br>Filled the hall with passionate outcry.<br><br>A hundred voices rose in plea,<br>Some cried, some yelled, all felt the plea,<br>Safe consumption sites, a contentious cause,<br>In suburban Vancouver, a tempest roars.<br><br>Mounties wade through the heated fray,<br>In Richmond, where the conflict lay,<br>A battle of wills, of values, of fear,<br>The clash of opinions, strong and clear.
