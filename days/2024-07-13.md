In Chicago, where Cubbies play with glee,<br>Their latest mishap brings no jubilee,<br>A pitcher with a hand that's now askew,<br>Leaves fans feeling utterly blue.<br><br>From the dugout to dislocated fate,<br>The team is left to ponder and wait,<br>Will this setback bring the Cubs down low,<br>Or will they rise, stronger to show?<br><br>Oh, the woes that plague this baseball crew,<br>Injuries striking out of the blue,<br>But hope springs eternal for the fans,<br>As they rally behind their beloved clan.<br><br>From broken bones to shattered dreams,<br>Nothing is quite as dire as it seems,<br>For the Cubs will fight with all their might,<br>To overcome this challenging plight.<br><br>So let's cheer on the Chicago crew,<br>As they navigate this trial anew,<br>With hearts full of hope and faith so strong,<br>The Cubs will rise, where they belong.
