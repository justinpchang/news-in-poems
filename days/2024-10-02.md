Missiles fill the sky,<br>Middle East ablaze with ire,<br>Peace a distant dream.<br><br>Fury unleashed high,<br>Loyalties in fire and ash,<br>Nations at crossroads.<br><br>In the chaos, a tale,<br>Of a horse noble and brave,<br>Honored in the end.<br><br>Amidst the turmoil,<br>A steed garners royal praise,<br>In war's solemn dance.
