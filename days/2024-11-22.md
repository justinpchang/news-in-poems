In Michigan's land of snow and cheer,<br>A theft of props brought panic near,<br>Yet dancers rallied, hearts sincere,<br>To save their "Nutcracker" premiere.<br><br>Through stolen sets and props so dear,<br>Their show must go on, loud and clear,<br>With boundless spirit, they persevere,<br>In this holiday tale so sincere.<br><br>With unity, they calm their fear,<br>Each dancer, volunteer, and peer,<br>In Plymouth's winter atmosphere,<br>The show will shine, never to disappear.
