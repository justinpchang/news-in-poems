Ode to the Fallen Sky<br><br>In the region of Belgorod, near the border there,<br>A Russian plane took to the air,<br>With prisoners of war, Ukrainian souls,<br>Destined for freedom, or so it was told.<br><br>A military transport, grand and strong,<br>Carrying sixty-five brave hearts along,<br>Their fate uncertain, their future unclear,<br>As they embarked on a journey filled with fear.<br><br>The Russian Defense Ministry did confess,<br>Of the prisoners aboard, in their distress,<br>To be exchanged for their Russian kin,<br>In a hopeful exchange, where peace could begin.<br><br>But alas, tragedy struck in the sky,<br>As the plane crashed, causing hearts to cry,<br>A giant fireball, an explosion of despair,<br>Leaving us wondering, if anyone was spared.<br><br>The news agencies reported, they had their say,<br>But could not verify, on that fateful day,<br>The fate of the prisoners and the three others,<br>Lost in the wreckage amidst the smothers.<br><br>Ukraine's agencies remained silent, it's true,<br>Unable to comment on this tragic view,<br>The Ukrainian Defense Ministry deep in thought,<br>As Suspilne reported, their words were sought.<br><br>The Ukrainian Air Force, bound by time,<br>Could not yet speak of this harrowing crime,<br>Leaving us to wonder, to question and wait,<br>If any survivors will emerge from this state.<br><br>And in the midst of the uncertainty and pain,<br>Baza, a Russian channel, shared a visual stain,<br>A video, they claimed, of the tragic descent,<br>A terrifying sight, to our hearts' lament.<br><br>Oh, fallen sky, witness to sorrow and woe,<br>Your mighty wings failed you, causing hearts to grow,<br>The souls of the fallen, forever we'll mourn,<br>May peace find them, wherever they are borne.<br><br>Let us remember the prisoners, brave and true,<br>Their lives cut short, their fate we now rue,<br>In the realm of the sky, where heartache resides,<br>May their spirits find solace as our tears subside.<br><br>In this ode to the fallen, we honor their name,<br>May the world remember, and share in their pain,<br>The Russian plane crashes, a tragedy so grim,<br>Let us pray for healing, as hope's light grows dim.
