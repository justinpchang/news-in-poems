In the halls of power, a victory is claimed,<br>Republicans reign as the G.O.P. is named.<br>Their trifecta secured under Trump's guiding light,<br>With control of the House, they'll shape the nation's plight.<br><br>The vulnerable are shielded, their seats maintained,<br>As Democrats fall, their efforts strained.<br>Competitive districts now painted red,<br>A unified Congress, where Trump's words are spread.<br><br>With power consolidated, their agenda set,<br>The stage is theirs, a scene to fret.<br>Will this be a time of progress and change?<br>Or a chapter of turmoil, both eerie and strange.
