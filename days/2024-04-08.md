In Ukraine's frontline villages drear,<br>Where echoes of war ring loud and clear,<br>Battered homes, fields filled with fear,<br>Yet residents stay, their courage sheer.<br><br>Amidst the scars of battles fought,<br>Their spirits strong, never distraught,<br>Volunteers bring aid they've sought,<br>In this unending test they've caught.<br><br>Through shelling sounds that never cease,<br>They hold on to fragments of peace,<br>Their love for home will never decrease,<br>In war's shadow, they find release.<br><br>A land where life and death entwine,<br>In the frontline villages they shine,<br>Their endurance a tale most divine,<br>In Ukraine's heart, a resilient sign.
