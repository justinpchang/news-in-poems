In the heart of Rwanda, a nation torn,<br>By bloodshed and violence, its people mourn.<br>Militiamen marauding, wreaking havoc and fear,<br>Leaving behind painful memories, oh so near.<br><br>Florence, a mother, faced with despair,<br>Hiding her children, her heart laid bare.<br>Her husband's last words etched in her mind,<br>A preacher's strength, so noble and kind.<br><br>A nation scarred, by genocide's woe,<br>800,000 lives lost, a devastating blow.<br>Thirty years later, the pain endures,<br>In each heart, the memory ensures. <br><br>In Kabuga's quiet, the echoes resound,<br>Of horrors past, on hallowed ground.<br>Rwanda's anniversary, a somber day,<br>As survivors honor those taken away.
