In Canada's past,  <br>Mulroney's name will last.  <br>NAFTA's face, divided state,  <br>Legacy of love and hate.  <br>  <br>In the U.S., softly call,  <br>Talks unnoticed, standing tall.  <br>Mulroney's vision, trade in flow,  <br>Allegations tarnish, fans let go.  <br>  <br>In Florida's warmth, he rests,  <br>A leader put to final tests.  <br>His story told, a journey grand,  <br>Mulroney's mark on Canada's land.
