In Turkey's land of grandeur and awe,<br>A cable car's tragedy none foresaw.<br>One soul lost in a fatal dance,<br>As news of sorrow spreads, hearts in a trance.<br><br>Through mountains high and skies so vast,<br>The cable car journey was meant to last.<br>But fate had plans of a different kind,<br>Leaving one passenger's loved ones behind.<br><br>In a split second, life's fragile thread broke,<br>Leaving a community in sorrow to soak.<br>As the cable car accident took its toll,<br>In Turkey, sadness overtakes the soul.
