Oh Canada, prepare for soccer's great stage,<br>The World Cup of twenty twenty-six,<br>Where nations will battle and hearts will engage,<br>With cheers and cries, the crowd intermix.<br><br>In Vancouver, a city so full of grace,<br>Seven matches will grace its sacred ground,<br>With renovated stadium now in place,<br>Where dreams of victory and glory abound.<br><br>Toronto too, will have its shining hour,<br>Six matches it shall proudly call its own,<br>The first involving Canada's power,<br>A nation united, strength fully shown.<br><br>But alas, the cost of this grand affair,<br>Is one that's not entirely clear,<br>For Qatar, with its new stadiums rare,<br>Spare no expense, the riches they share.<br><br>Yet Canada's efforts, modest they may be,<br>A renovation here, some new seats there,<br>In Vancouver, B.C. Place shall now see,<br>A sprucing up, but will it dare compare?<br><br>And Toronto, with precise calculations,<br>Adds temporary seats to expand the fold,<br>A grand spectacle for all generations,<br>To witness victories, unforgettable and bold.<br><br>Montreal, alas, did drop out the race,<br>Funding concerns halting its dreams,<br>But fear not, dear Canada, find your place,<br>In this global stage, where hope gleams.<br><br>Oh World Cup, bring us joy and delight,<br>In Canada's embrace, we all unite.
