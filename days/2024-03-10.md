In Brighton, a mystery unfurled,<br>A man found dead, tragedy swirled,<br>Amidst the flames that fiercely burned,<br>A woman arrested, whispers turned.<br><br>In shadows of the night she roamed,<br>In a basement flat, a man's life to entomb,<br>The fire's glow, her tale untold,<br>Suspicions rise, in whispers cold.<br><br>The sirens wailed, the neighbors peek,<br>A life snuffed out, in whispers bleak,<br>Brighton shrouded in sorrow deep,<br>As secrets in the dark silently keep.
