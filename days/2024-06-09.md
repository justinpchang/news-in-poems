In the realm of romance, a guild did decree,<br>A bankruptcy filing causing quite a spree,<br>The writers of America in despair,<br>Their conference dreams now stripped bare.<br><br>No spaces for meetings, no gatherings grand,<br>The love stories silenced across the land,<br>Infighting and whispers of racism severe,<br>Bringing down a once celebrated premier.<br><br>Romantic tales now left in disarray,<br>As the guild struggles to find a better way,<br>What fate awaits the writers' art so dear,<br>Will love still bloom, or disappear?
