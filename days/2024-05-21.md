In Vovchansk's streets,<br>Russian forces draw near, swift,<br>War's shadow looms large.<br><br>Ukrainian town,<br>Caught in the midst of turmoil,<br>Hope flickers, still strong.<br><br>The world holds its breath,<br>As borders blur with conflict,<br>Prayers for peace ascend.<br><br>In Vovchansk's heart,<br>Courage rises like the dawn,<br>In the face of war.
