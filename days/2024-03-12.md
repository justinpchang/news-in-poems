In Windsor stood the castle grand and fair,<br>Where tourists roamed to breathe the royal air,<br>But on this morn, a crash broke the peace,<br>As vehicles collided, causing havoc cease.<br><br>Amidst the chaos outside the royal gate,<br>Emergency crews rushed to alter fate,<br>With sirens blaring, they swiftly came near,<br>To aid the wounded, calming all fear.<br><br>The castle walls, witness to the collision's might,<br>As car met stone in a chaotic sight,<br>In the shadow of history's embrace,<br>A moment of chaos, in this tranquil place.
