Oh, plastic trouble lurks in every nook,<br>From oceans blue to babbling brook.<br>In the healthcare realm, a staggering sight,<br>Inhalers and EpiPens add to plastic's blight.<br><br>Negotiations stall, industries clash,<br>Over single-use plastics that create a rash.<br>Fossil fuels and chemicals play their hand,<br>While the world's health care plastics expand.<br><br>Treaty proposals aim to cut the waste,<br>As we strive for a cleaner, greener taste.<br>But the plastic production knows no quell,<br>Inhalers and EpiPens weaving a plastic spell.
