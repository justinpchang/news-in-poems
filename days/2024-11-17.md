In castles high, the royals dwell,<br>Guarded by knights who never fell.<br>But thieves broke in, a daring fight,<br>To steal treasures in the dead of night.<br><br>---<br>Biden's decree, a bold new height,<br>Ukraine's strike on Russia in sight.<br>The ban is lifted, tensions rise,<br>In shadows where diplomacy lies.<br><br>---<br>A royal raid, a kingdom's shame,<br>The crown jewels gone, no one to blame.<br>But in the land of politics and might,<br>Striking decisions keep us in night.<br><br>---<br>Now the world watches, heartbeats roar,<br>As nations clash and secrets pour.<br>In a dance of power and might,<br>The future hangs in delicate flight.
