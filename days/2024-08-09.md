In Columbia's halls, a heated debate,<br>Three deans in trouble, sealing their fate,<br>Texts with antisemitic tones they sent,<br>Mocking students, their discontent.<br><br>Oh, what a scandal, what a shame,<br>Resignation now, they take the blame,<br>Words that cut like a sharpened knife,<br>In the digital realm, sparking strife.<br><br>Their texts revealed a darker side,<br>From positions of power, they could not hide,<br>A lesson learned, but at what cost,<br>In the land where freedom and respect are crossed.<br><br>Columbia's name now stained with doubt,<br>As these deans' words were brought to light,<br>May they serve as a cautionary tale,<br>Of the consequences of words set to sail.
