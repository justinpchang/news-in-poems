Oh Chiquita, banana of renown,<br>In court, your darker deeds have now been found,<br>For in Colombia's war, a terror sowed,<br>With lives lost, your complicity showed.<br><br>Your sweet fruit hides a bitter truth,<br>Funding terror in its ruthless youth,<br>In US courts, justice has its say,<br>For those lost in this deadly fray.<br><br>Banana brand now tarnished, besmirched,<br>Liable for the lives that were mercilessly perched,<br>Colombian Civil War's painful toll,<br>Chiquita's involvement takes its toll.
