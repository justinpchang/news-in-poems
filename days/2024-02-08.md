Ode to Literary Conversations<br><br>In distant lands of prose and verse,<br>Where tales of history do disperse,<br>Books from Mexico, Netherlands, and Japan,<br>Bring rewrites of history, teen tales in their span.<br><br>A pleasure it is, no doubt, to see,<br>Books in translation, diverse and free,<br>Mexican writer Enrigue takes the lead,<br>His novel, You Dreamed of Empires, is indeed<br>A counterfactual tale of Cortés at Moctezuma's side,<br>Where mushrooms and peyote take them on a wild ride.<br><br>A drug-tinged odyssey through a political game,<br>Intrigue and power drive the characters, not fame,<br>With historical detail and hallucinatory dreams,<br>Enrigue's novel flows like a psychedelic stream.<br>A glimpse of Mexico's past, a reflection of today,<br>A portrait of jockeying men in a government's disarray.<br><br>But Enrigue offers no allegory with this tale,<br>Let meanings reveal themselves, he does impale,<br>Intricate characters, both slippery and profound,<br>Their empathy and hatred in a delicate balance are found.<br>A colossal achievement, this alternate 16th century,<br>The conquistadores making things up, their results extraordinary.<br><br>Onto the Dutch debut, Atangana Bekono's Confrontations,<br>A tale of Salomé, a teenager's revelations,<br>In a juvenile detention center she resides,<br>Her story, a reflection of power struggles that abide.<br>With a sparse setting and stick figure friends,<br>In Salomé's head, the narrative bends,<br>Between her father's advice of hard work and no moaning,<br>And her Aunt's reminders that power will leave her groaning.<br><br>A didactic approach leaves little room for surprise,<br>The message clear, but complexity it denies,<br>A missed opportunity, where exploration should thrive,<br>Confrontations fails to truly come alive.<br><br>Finally, we journey to Japan's shores,<br>Kiyoko Murata's novel, A Woman of Pleasure, soars,<br>In turn-of-the-century Kumamoto, a fancy brothel resides,<br>An intricate character study that powerfully presides.<br>Ichi, a girl sold to the brothel at fifteen,<br>With her journey, the novel takes its keen,<br>From dialect to education, her growth takes shape,<br>In the context of labor unrest, a collective consciousness awakes.<br><br>Murata's prose, brisk and lyrical, moves,<br>From haiku to broken journal entries, it behooves,<br>The lessons Ichi learns amidst her labor of tide,<br>Self-determination, physical and intellectual, as her guide.<br>A stirring ode to freedom, where women demand their rights,<br>A Woman of Pleasure shines with its empowering lights.<br><br>These books from worlds apart, in conversation they dwell,<br>Transcending borders, their stories do excel,<br>From Mexico to Netherlands to Japan's embrace,<br>They bring rewrites of history, teen tales with grace.<br>Literary journeys, diverse and profound,<br>Letting us explore different worlds, each resound.
