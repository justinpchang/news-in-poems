In the southern lands, Helene did roam,<br>Leaving trails of flooding in its mighty foam.<br>From Florida to the Carolinas grand,<br>Catastrophic floods covered the land.<br><br>Waters rose, homes were lost in the deluge,<br>Nature's wrath, there was no refuge.<br>Dozens of lives taken by the storm's cruel hand,<br>Leaving behind a shattered land.<br><br>The post-tropical cyclone wreaked its havoc high,<br>As it crossed the mountains, reaching for the sky.<br>North Carolina and Tennessee felt the pain,<br>As Helene's fury poured down like rain.
