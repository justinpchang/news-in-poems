In shadows, my partner waved as I sailed away,<br>A hidden gesture filled with love, quiet and gay.<br>Banned for who we are, yet now we stand tall,<br>LGBT veterans, proud, we've conquered it all.<br><br>A monument rises, telling our untold story,<br>Years of struggle, of bravery and glory.<br>Forced out unjustly, we never lost the fight,<br>Now we shine in the sun, our futures burning bright.<br><br>Onward we march, with pride in our hearts,<br>Each step a testament, each moment a new start.<br>Shackles broken, chains unbound,<br>LGBT veterans, forever profound.
