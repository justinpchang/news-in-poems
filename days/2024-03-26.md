Oh, Kelly Moran, pianist fair,<br>Encountered by Irena's heartfelt stare,<br>In a town where memories are bittersweet,<br>Their lives entwined in a fate's mystique.<br><br>At a funeral, they crossed paths,<br>In sorrow's clutch, their bond it clasps,<br>A mixtape request, a musical thread,<br>Began a journey where hearts are led.<br><br>With 28 albums in a Dropbox exchange,<br>Their friendship blossomed, a path so strange,<br>Through melodies and harmonious tunes,<br>They found solace under sorrow's moon.<br><br>In a fusion of grief and newfound light,<br>Kelly and Irena, in music unite,<br>A tale of healing, through notes and keys,<br>A friendship born from such tragedies.<br><br>In Midtown's piano studio grand,<br>Their bond solidified, hand in hand,<br>From high school hearts to present day,<br>Their music guiding the healing way.
