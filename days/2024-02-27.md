Marble walls whisper,<br>Echoes of divided past,<br>Tax breaks face farewell.<br><br>Confederate ghosts sigh,<br>As heritage trembles close,<br>Culture war now rages.<br><br>In the heart of Richmond,<br>United Daughters watch on,<br>Legacy under threat.<br><br>Governor's choice now,<br>To break ties of olden days,<br>Virginia's rebirth.
