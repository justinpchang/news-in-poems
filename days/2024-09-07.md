In Gaza, where tensions brew and boil,<br>Satellites tell a tale of toil.<br>Israel's roadwork, smooth and grand,<br>A sign that peace is not close at hand.<br><br>With asphalt laid and gravel spread,<br>The path of progress, where once was dread.<br>A message clear for all to see,<br>That Gaza's fate still hangs in uncertainty.<br><br>The world watches from afar,<br>As politics wage another scar.<br>A road being paved, yet where does it lead?<br>In Gaza, questions plant their seed.<br><br>But amidst the dust and construction noise,<br>Hope flickers like a distant poise.<br>Perhaps one day, this road will show,<br>The way to peace, a path to sow.
