In Gaza's heart, a poet roamed,<br>Capturing sorrows felt and moaned,<br>Motaz Azaiza, with lens aglow,<br>Exposed the pain, yet little to show.<br><br>Through streets of strife, he bravely trod,<br>With camera lens, he played his ode,<br>Yet 'Nothing Changed,' his mournful cry,<br>As Gaza's echoes faded into the sky.<br><br>In the ambulance's frantic race,<br>Paramedics brave, with sorrow on face,<br>Their tales untold, their burden immense,<br>Yet Gaza's suffering, a cycle intense.<br><br>Life behind the fence, a stark divide,<br>Where hope and despair closely abide,<br>A world apart, but not so far,<br>In Gaza's shadow, a silent scar.<br><br>In Jerusalem's speeches, a political dance,<br>As gunfire echoes in Gaza's expanse,<br>A tale of two worlds, intertwined yet apart,<br>Where peace remains a distant art.<br><br>In a region torn by endless fight,<br>Where darkness shrouds both day and night,<br>Motaz Azaiza's lens did frame,<br>The pain, the loss, the eternal flame.
