In shadows deep, a plan begins to brew,<br>Foreign lands with schemes both dark and true.<br>Russia, China, Iran, a trio sly,<br>To cast doubt, to make American trust fly.<br><br>Whispers in the night of false claims spun sharp,<br>Aiming to tear democracy apart.<br>Adversaries plot, their motives clear,<br>Injecting poison into what we hold dear.<br><br>United they stand, in mischief's delight,<br>Planting seeds of chaos, sowing with spite.<br>But Americans strong, will not bend or sway,<br>In the face of deceit, we'll stand firm this day.<br><br>Blank verse.<br><br>Let the world watch as we hold our ground,<br>In the face of falsehood, in justice profound.<br>For the land of the brave, home of the free,<br>Will rise above, shining bright for all to see.
