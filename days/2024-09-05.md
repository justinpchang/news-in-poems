In Winder, Georgia, where fields once did lay,<br>A city evolving, growing without delay,<br>Middling and rural, with a pace all its own,<br>Yet tragedy strikes, in a school unknown.<br><br>The population surges, changing with time,<br>In this rapidly developing paradigm,<br>But amidst progress and prosperity's gleam,<br>The echoes of violence disrupt this serene dream.<br><br>Families shattered, a community mourns,<br>In the midst of growth, a tragedy scorns,<br>Winder, Georgia, a city at a crossroad,<br>Where progress meets sorrow, the story is told.
