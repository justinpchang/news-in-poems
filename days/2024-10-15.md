In Africa, where children need sustenance,<br>Supplies deplete, a famine's dire stance.<br>UNICEF's plea for aid is urgent now,<br>For two million kids, hope's in short supply somehow.<br><br>With nutrients scarce, each hungry cry,<br>Breaks the hearts of those who wonder why<br>Famine's grip tightens, relentless and cold,<br>Leaving innocent lives at risk, untold.<br><br>Blanket forts fall, laughter fades away,<br>As hunger's shadow darkens the day.<br>But in the face of this looming strife,<br>We must stand together to bring back life.<br><br>Together, let's fight this battle so stark,<br>And light hope's flame in the darkest of dark.<br>For every child deserves a chance to thrive,<br>Let's ensure no more dreams fade and dive.
