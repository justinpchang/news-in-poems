In Cuba where hurricanes dance,<br>Blackout's grip puts up a stance.<br>Oscar rages, the land to drench,<br>Yet the island's spirit won't quench.<br><br>Their power flickers, fades to dark,<br>Leaving residents with naught but stark.<br>As Oscar howls through the night,<br>Cubans brace for another plight.<br><br>Struggling under a heavy hand,<br>The government tries to withstand.<br>But the people, weary and tired,<br>On the brink, their patience expired.
