Oh plastic, pervasive in our world so wide,<br>Invisible chemical foes ever abide,<br>Through the air we breathe, the food we eat,<br>Exposing us all to plastic's deceit.<br><br>In meetings grand, the U.N. did convene,<br>To discuss the impact, the dangers unseen,<br>A dozen officials, their bodies did show,<br>Chemicals from plastics, where did they go?<br><br>Plastic talks continue, a dire warning cry,<br>As we realize the truth, cannot deny,<br>From bottles to bags, their presence clear,<br>Invisible threats that we all fear.<br><br>So let's heed the call, let's act with haste,<br>Before our bodies become the toxic waste,<br>Reduce, reuse, and recycle with glee,<br>For a world free from plastic, let that be the decree.
