In Iran, where ballet once did thrive,<br>A tale of struggle, passion, and strive,<br>Dancers holding on with all their might,<br>To dance, to leap, to reach for the light.<br><br>The white feather of grace and poise,<br>Met with challenges, silenced voices,<br>Forced to sit, not permitted to dance,<br>Yearning for freedom, taking a chance.<br><br>They dreamt of stages, of flights so grand,<br>But faced a fate not what they planned,<br>Their plea for art fell on deaf ears,<br>As they sought to break free from their fears.<br><br>Oh, the plight of dancers in Iran,<br>A story of resistance, a noble stand,<br>With hearts of courage, they refused to conform,<br>Their love for ballet, a firestorm.
