Tax Season's Villain<br><br>In tax season's gloom,<br>Misery fills the room,<br>Blaming I.R.S,<br>For a painful mess.<br><br>But listen closely,<br>For the truth you'll see,<br>The villain's not the taxman,<br>But a system not well-planned.<br><br>Filing should be a breeze,<br>No burdensome fees,<br>Just like in lands afar,<br>Where taxes aren't bizarre.<br><br>Oh, America, wake up,<br>From this convoluted setup,<br>Why must we endure,<br>A tax system so obscure?<br><br>Bureaucracy entwined,<br>Complexity defined,<br>Forcing us to seek aid,<br>Our pockets left dismayed.<br><br>The culprit is not I.R.S,<br>But a system that won't progress,<br>Let's demand a change,<br>And free us from this strange.<br><br>Simplicity we plead,<br>No more wallets in need,<br>Let tax filing be free,<br>For all the land to see.<br><br>So rise up, dear nation,<br>Demand tax liberation,<br>Let's reform and clear,<br>The villain from tax season's sphere.
