In lands afar where dragons once did soar,<br>Xena Lin joins the gold rush with a thrill,<br>Buying "beans," morsels of gold galore,<br>Investing wisely in an age old skill.<br><br>Her fingertips hold nuggets glittering bright,<br>A fraction of an ounce, a steal so bold,<br>To watch gold's climb, a wondrous sight,<br>Inspiring investments, turning hearts cold.<br><br>China, the player in this golden game,<br>Propelling prices to the highest peaks,<br>As tensions rise, they stake their claim,<br>In the market where precious metal speaks.<br><br>The world watches as this tale unfolds,<br>With gold's allure, the story never gets old.
