In Dubai's dazzling city bright,<br>Where stars shine and glam takes flight,<br>A rapper's voice rings loud and clear,<br>Accusing ties that some do fear.<br><br>Macklemore's bold words ignite spark,<br>In UAE, where shadows lurk dark,<br>Allegations of links unveiled,<br>To Sudan's dark past, still unveiled.<br><br>Will more stars now boycott the scene,<br>In Dubai's glitz, where world's elite convene?<br>Or will they turn a blind eye, choose to feign,<br>While controversy dances in the desert domain? <br><br>Oh Dubai, land of opulence and charm,<br>Where secrets hide beneath the palm,<br>Will the stars dare to take a stand,<br>Or be swayed by riches, drawn to the sand?
