In nursery rhymes of kindness, he will shine,<br>A story spun with care, so genuine,<br>James Norton, with his voice, will intertwine,<br>Bedtime tales for children, so divine.<br><br>Through twinkling stars, his words will softly flow,<br>A tale of managing the mammoth's show,<br>Type 1 diabetes, a foe to know,<br>Yet with grace and poise, he'll let it go.<br><br>In cozy corners, books and dreams collide,<br>A hero's whisper fighting by their side,<br>As Norton's soothing voice becomes their guide,<br>Into the night, where fears and worries hide.<br><br>So let the children gather, snug and tight,<br>As James unfolds the story of the night,<br>Of mammoths, diabetes, shining bright,<br>His voice, a lullaby, a gentle light.
