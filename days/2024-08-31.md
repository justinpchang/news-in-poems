Oh, tell me of the burden borne,<br>Of 'black tax' that weighs forlorn,<br>Young Africans in a heartfelt plea,<br>Yearning to break tradition's decree.<br><br>Elsa Majimbo, with words so sharp,<br>Her rant awoke a slumbering harp,<br>Questioning the norm, sparking debate,<br>Should love's currency carry this weight?<br><br>Generations past, a timeless call,<br>Sending money, a familial thrall,<br>But now the young, with minds ablaze,<br>Seeking a new path in changing days.<br><br>Influencer's voice, a potent force,<br>Challenging a custom's course,<br>To lighten wallets, unchain the heart,<br>And find a fresh, less heavy start.
