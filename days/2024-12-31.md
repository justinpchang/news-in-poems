In '76, a friendship started to flourish,  <br>Biden and Carter, a bond they'd nourish.  <br>Through twists and turns, in politics they'd roam,  <br>Decades of friendship, like sweet honeycomb.<br><br>In Capitol corridors, whispers and jokes,  <br>Biden and Carter, a friendship that evokes  <br>The laughter shared in tough political times,  <br>An alliance enduring, like old oak's chimes.<br><br>A duo from different walks of life they be,  <br>Yet united in values, bold and free.  <br>Jimmy and Joe, a partnership tried and true,  <br>An enduring tale, just like morning dew.
