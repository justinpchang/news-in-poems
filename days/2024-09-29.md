Oh, the thrill of democracy's dance,<br>In Nebraska, a peculiar chance,<br>Where rural voices hold the key,<br>Deciding the nation's destiny.<br><br>As ballots cast and tallies rise,<br>The heartland's power will arise,<br>In November's crucial election fight,<br>Shaping the country's path, so bright.<br><br>With cornfields whispering in the wind,<br>And prairies vast where dreams rescind,<br>Nebraska's vote, a pivotal stand,<br>Guiding the ship of state, so grand.
