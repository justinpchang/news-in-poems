In Barcelona streets where flair abounds,<br>Locals wield squirt guns, no time for bounds.<br>‘Go home’ signs bob, a whimsical stand,<br>Against the tourist flood sweeping the land.<br><br>Tourists flock in, with cameras in hand,<br>Locals resist, their anger-chords all strung.<br>Amidst the beauty, a hidden distress,<br>Housing shortages, a city under duress.<br><br>A playful protest in the Spanish sun,<br>A clash of cultures, a battle begun.<br>Squirt guns and ‘go home’ signs in the air,<br>Barcelona's cry, for all to be aware.
