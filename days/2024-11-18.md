In Ohio's capital, a shocking scene,<br>Neo-Nazis on the streets so mean.<br>Racial slurs fill the air with hate,<br>Officials condemn, their actions berate.<br><br>Through Columbus the marchers strolled,<br>Their message of hate, dark and cold.<br>A pattern of supremacist incidents arise,<br>In the land of the free, where equality lies.<br><br>Shocked faces turn to watch in fear,<br>As the neo-Nazis draw near.<br>But Ohio stands strong against this blight,<br>Uniting against hatred with all their might.<br><br>In the heart of the state, a stand is made,<br>Against bigotry and the division sowed.<br>In Columbus, unity will prevail,<br>As love and peace in the end will unveil.
