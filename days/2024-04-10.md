In Gaza's solemn streets, Eid prayers resound,<br>Amid destruction and rain, hearts deeply bound,<br>In the aftermath of conflict, they stand tall,<br>Unified in faith, despite it all.<br><br>Their voices rise in prayer and plea,<br>Seeking peace in a land that longs to be free,<br>In the face of adversity and pain,<br>Their resilience shines, like a steadfast flame.<br><br>The heavy clouds above may weep,<br>But their spirit, strong and deep,<br>Guides them through the darkest hour,<br>United in prayer, they find power.<br><br>So let us gaze upon their awe,<br>Their strength in the face of war,<br>Gazans in unity, amidst the rain,<br>Performing Eid prayers, their hope sustained.
