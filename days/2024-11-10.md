In somber tones, the papers speak of duty,<br>Kate's grace at the Cenotaph, a royal beauty.<br>Her solemn presence, a tribute to the fallen,<br>In reverence she stands, remembrance enshrined, embolden.<br><br>A princess in black, among the sea of poppies,<br>A symbol of respect, honoring past hopes and copies.<br>The weight of history reflected in her eyes,<br>A moment captured, where nobility never dies.<br><br>In hushed whispers, her actions are analyzed,<br>Each step, each gesture, carefully prized.<br>For in her solemn duty to remember and reflect,<br>The Princess of Wales, her legacy perfect.<br><br>Amidst the silence and the tolling bells,<br>Her presence at the Cenotaph magically dwells.<br>A reminder of sacrifice, of love and loss,<br>A timeless tribute, beneath history's gloss.
