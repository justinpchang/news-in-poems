In forests wild and flames ablaze,<br>Women brave, in their own ways,<br>Organize for support they seek,<br>To pursue their firefighting peak.<br><br>Through smoke and heat, they fiercely fight,<br>Their passion burning, shining bright,<br>No longer bound by old clich√©s,<br>They chase their dreams, in brighter rays.<br><br>United now, a stronger force,<br>Breaking barriers, changing course,<br>Their voices strong, their flames alight,<br>Female firefighters, fierce and bright.
