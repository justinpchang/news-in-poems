In the National Guard, Walz did rise,<br>With dedication in his eyes,<br>Three decades of service, strong and true,<br>But a hard decision he had to pursue.<br><br>Some peers questioned his timing tall,<br>As he bid farewell to the Army’s call,<br>Though his rise was steady and his service grand,<br>It seems his legacy might not withstand.<br><br>In the ranks, he climbed with pride,<br>His duty he never tried to hide,<br>But now a chapter comes to a close,<br>Leaving behind both highs and lows.<br><br>A hard decision, a final stand,<br>In the National Guard, Walz’s hand,<br>His rise was steady, his journey long,<br>In the echoes of his service song.
