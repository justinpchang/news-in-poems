Oh, the football pitch doth stir with ire,<br>As Glentoran’s manager doth mire,<br>In frustration, he doth declare,<br>Of referee’s choice, so unfair.<br><br>A goalie’s folly escaped the red card's touch,<br>Leaving fans and players in a hush,<br>Did Walsh evade the ref’s keen eye,<br>Or was it just a slip on the sly?<br><br>In the heat of the match, the tension grows,<br>Debates rage on, everyone knows,<br>Was it a blunder, a mistake to mourn?<br>Or just a twist in football’s thorny thorn?<br><br>Oh, the drama that doth unfold,<br>In the world of football, so bold,<br>A moment missed, a call unseen,<br>Leaves us wondering what might have been.
