In a Victorian house with secrets untold,<br>A baby's story, ancient and cold,<br>Entombed beneath the creaky floor,<br>Lost to time, now seeking more.<br><br>Generations passed, unaware,<br>Of the tragedy lingering there,<br>Now the search for kinfolk begins,<br>To unearth the past, where sorrow spins.<br><br>The walls whisper tales of yore,<br>Of a family fractured, hearts sore,<br>Mystery shrouded in dust and decay,<br>An infant's fate, hidden away.<br><br>Centuries of silence finally break,<br>As the truth stirs, no longer fake,<br>The search for relatives, a quest,<br>To honor the babe, finally rest.
