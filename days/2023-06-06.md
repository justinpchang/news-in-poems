In a classroom she stood, with chalk in hand,<br>Teaching children how to read, a sacred demand.<br>But little did she know, the errors she would spread,<br>Millions of kids led astray, by the wrong way she led.<br><br>From her lips flowed the words, sounding oh so sweet,<br>But the letters and sounds they did not neatly meet.<br>Her method, a concoction of confusion and distortion,<br>Leaving young minds tangled in a web of misfortune.<br><br>The children would gather, eager to learn,<br>But what they received was a twisted discern.<br>She tossed aside phonics, the foundation of words,<br>Replacing it with a method that was simply absurd.<br><br>Whole language she championed, sight words were her creed,<br>Ignoring the alphabet's song they so desperately need.<br>With no understanding of sounds or their connection,<br>Reading became a puzzle, a source of frustration.<br><br>Parents watched in dismay as their children struggled,<br>Frustration grew, the hope of reading smuggled.<br>The blame fell on this teacher, this misguided guide,<br>Who failed to equip these kids for the reading tide.<br><br>But now, the truth must come to light,<br>For these young minds deserve what is right.<br>A new generation of teachers must rise,<br>And break these chains of illiteracy's disguise.<br><br>With phonics in their hearts, and letters on their lips,<br>They'll guide the children in their reading trips.<br>No longer tricked by the wrong way to read,<br>The path to literacy will clearly lead.<br><br>So let us learn from this woeful tale,<br>And ensure our children's minds never fail.<br>Let phonics be the bedrock of their learning,<br>And in their reading journey, let them keep on yearning.
