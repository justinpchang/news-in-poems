In a village quiet and serene,<br>Tragedy struck, a sight so keen.<br>Father and son, their lives cut short,<br>In a crash, a community fraught.<br><br>Gone too soon, their names now we mourn,<br>From dusk till dawn, we sadly adorn.<br>Peter and Loughlin, taken away,<br>Leaving our hearts heavy, in dismay.<br><br>A family shattered, a void so deep,<br>In sorrow, their memories we'll keep.<br>Through the tears and the pain we bear,<br>In Killylea's hearts, love and care we share.
