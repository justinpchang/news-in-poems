In a world where climate change looms large and bold,<br>Diplomats and leaders convene, stories to be told.<br>COP29 brings nations to the table so wide,<br>To discuss our planet's future, no place left to hide.<br><br>Donald Trump's win shakes the room, sets the tone,<br>For this climate talk, seeds of discord sown.<br>Will his policies hinder progress, slow the pace?<br>Or will the world unite, find a common grace?<br><br>As nations share visions, ideas take flight,<br>Hope for a greener planet, shining bright.<br>In COP29's halls, decisions take shape,<br>For our Earthâ€™s sake, may they not escape.<br><br>Amidst the chaos and political strains,<br>Climate talks bring hope, where little remains.<br>Let's stand together, hand in hand,<br>To protect our Earth, on which we all stand.
