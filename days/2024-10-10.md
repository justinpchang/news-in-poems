In the night's silence, phones light up with need,<br>Crisis hotlines a beacon for those who plead.<br>Yet amidst the dark, a twisted game unfolds,<br>Deceitful calls, where decency is paroled.<br><br>Unveiling tales of sorrow, heartache bleeds,<br>Counselors lend a listening ear to misdeeds.<br>But hidden behind falsities they pose,<br>A venomous vine in virtue's fragrant rose.<br><br>Through wires whispering secrets untold,<br>Predators lurk, their vile intentions bold,<br>To twist and taint these sanctuaries of care,<br>Creating chaos where hope was once bared.<br><br>In a realm meant for solace and reprieve,<br>Such malevolence, hearts and minds deceive.<br>But within this darkness, a light will shine,<br>Standing strong against the vile, malign.
