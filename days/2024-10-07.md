In shadows, her plight is unseen, alas,<br>Forgotten by powers, she faces a test.<br>A mother's plea for her dear, lost lass.<br><br>Through echoes of chaos and clouds that amass,<br>A daughter held captive, in danger, distressed.<br>In shadows, her plight is unseen, alas.<br><br>Though days may pass and memories surpass,<br>Her mother's voice rises, a cry to address.<br>A mother's plea for her dear, lost lass.<br><br>In fear and in hope, time ticks like glass,<br>As the world spins on with its unrest.<br>In shadows, her plight is unseen, alas.<br><br>A plea for rescue, a desperate morass,<br>Prayers carried on the winds, never at rest.<br>A mother's plea for her dear, lost lass.<br><br>Let's not forget in the world's ever-changing class,<br>One soul lost among the furious mess.<br>In shadows, her plight is unseen, alas.<br>A mother's plea for her dear, lost lass.
