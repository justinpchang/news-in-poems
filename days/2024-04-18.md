In Tajikistan, a land of mountains high,<br>A mother weeps, questions fill her eye,<br>Her son, accused of ISIS's dangerous lie,<br>From dirt roads to terrorism, oh my.<br><br>From Tajik prisons, he emerged anew,<br>Bruised and battered, in a Russian courtroom's view,<br>Tajik recruits, ISIS-K's deadly crew,<br>Innocence lost, extremism grew.<br><br>Who lures the young from this peaceful land?<br>Into the grasp of terror's dreadful hand,<br>Tajikistan's name tarnished, it cannot withstand,<br>ISIS-K's recruits, an evil brand.<br><br>In courts, in concert halls, the fear does loom,<br>Tajiks in the midst of terror's gloom,<br>What drives these youths towards such doom,<br>ISIS's shadow, a nation's costume.
