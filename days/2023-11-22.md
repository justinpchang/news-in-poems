A golden delight,<br>Potato gratin meets<br>Hasselback's crisp bite.<br><br>Words come to life,<br>In books of a thousand tales,<br>Imagination thrives.<br><br>War's shadow looms large,<br>A boy's journey unfolds,<br>Heron's grace in charge.<br><br>Silent whispers heard,<br>Testing the aids of the ear,<br>Sound's victory stirred.<br><br>Challenge your knowledge,<br>Spelling Bee, the ultimate test,<br>Puzzles to acknowledge.<br><br>Tomorrow will come,<br>Briefing ends, until next day,<br>Knowledge keeps us bound.<br><br>Designing the sound,<br>The Times creates its app,<br>Technology's crown.
