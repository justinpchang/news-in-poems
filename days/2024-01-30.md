In Olympic ice rinks, they dance and glide,<br>With grace and elegance, their skills they hide.<br>But a scandal erupted, a tale of doping,<br>A Russian skater, her dreams now moping.<br><br>Kamila Valieva, a star on the ice,<br>Led her team to victory, shining bright.<br>But alas, her triumph was tainted with shame,<br>As she was banned for doping, bringing her fame to flame.<br><br>The International Skating Union, they did decree,<br>To strip Russia of their gold, so hastily.<br>And in an act that seemed quite bizarre,<br>They rearranged the standings, near and far.<br><br>The United States, they were bestowed,<br>The gold medal, their victory finally showed.<br>Japan, in second place, they found,<br>Their grace and skill, still renowned.<br><br>But what of Russia, with their tainted fame?<br>They were not cast aside, they were not to blame.<br>Instead, they were given a consolation prize,<br>The bronze medal, a truth that surely belies.<br><br>Canada, on the other hand, suffered a blow,<br>Expecting the bronze, they were left in woe.<br>A single point behind Russia's deceit,<br>Their dreams of glory, now incomplete.<br><br>In Olympic rinks, where dreams take flight,<br>A tale of triumph and scandal, now alight.<br>For skating's beauty, forever entwined,<br>With shadows of doping, a loss undefined.
