In Southport town, the bells do toll,<br>For Bebe King, a tender soul.<br>Her family asks for candles bright,<br>To honor her on this sad night.<br><br>The flames will dance, the shadows play,<br>A tribute to a life so brief.<br>In memory of Bebe's light,<br>Let candles flicker through the night.<br><br>So let us gather, hearts so heavy,<br>To light the way for Bebe's journey.<br>In moments dark, the flames shall glow,<br>A symbol of love that will always show.
