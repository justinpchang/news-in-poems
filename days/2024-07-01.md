In the world of cinema's light and shade,  <br>Jacquot and Doillon, talents once paraded,  <br>Now stand accused, their reputations at stake,  <br>For harming a child, their legacy to shake.  <br><br>Allegations of misconduct and abuse,  <br>A dark cloud hovering, casting a shadowy ruse,  <br>Judith Godr√®che, her voice now bold and true,  <br>Seeking justice for the harm she once knew.  <br><br>In the hands of justice, the filmmakers await,  <br>Their past deeds unraveling, sealing their fate,  <br>The industry shaken, its pillars now tremble,  <br>As the truth of their actions begins to assemble.  <br><br>May the light of truth shine bright and clear,  <br>Unveiling the secrets held dear,  <br>For no fame or talent can justify  <br>The innocence lost under a filmmaker's lie.
