In shadows of clouds, summer's warmth played coy,<br>A quiet start, the sun timid to deploy.<br>Could this be the time for skies of azure,<br>To grace us with its golden, sunlit treasure?<br><br>A dance of heat upon the blossoms' heads,<br>Awakening from winter's lingering beds.<br>Will we finally shed these layers, embrace,<br>The full embrace of summer's warm grace?<br><br>The promise of days without a chill in sight,<br>Picnics in meadows, under sun's bright light.<br>Could this be the turn we've all been longing for,<br>Summer knocking at our waiting, weary door.
