In the heart of homes, work now thrives,<br>But some claim it's not how labor survives,<br>Lord Rose's words igniting a fiery storm,<br>"We are not lazy," is the mighty reform.<br><br>From cozy beds to makeshift desks we stray,<br>In pajamas or suits, we toil away,<br>Zoom calls and emails our new daily chore,<br>Proving productivity knocks on home's door.<br><br>No commute woes or office politics at play,<br>Efficiency shines with the sun's first ray,<br>With cats as colleagues and kids close by,<br>Working from home, we reach for the sky.<br><br>So let it be known, our work is true,<br>Whether in an office or with a home view,<br>Critics may frown, but we stand strong and tall,<br>Working from home, we conquer all.
