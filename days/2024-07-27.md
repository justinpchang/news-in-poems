Oh Chloe, troubled by a curious affliction,<br>Your body's rebellion, a spectacle of friction.<br>Swelling attacks strike uninvited and bold,<br>A mystery to unfold, a tale to be told.<br><br>Invisible hands inflate you without warning,<br>A peculiar sight, your body transforming.<br>Doctors and experts puzzle in dismay,<br>Seeking a cure for you, night and day.<br><br>A life on the edge, a delicate dance,<br>With each swelling attack, a risky chance.<br>Oh Chloe, may relief and answers come,<br>To calm the storm within, to find a healing hum.
