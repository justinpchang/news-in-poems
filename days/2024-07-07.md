In Florida's sunny land of heat and shine,<br>Debate on warming temperatures entwined,<br>As lawmakers deny what's plain and clear,<br>The earth's distress, they choose to turn a blind ear.<br><br>The sunshine state, where heatwaves reign supreme,<br>But some refuse the warnings, it would seem,<br>A paradox as temperatures rise high,<br>While some in denial, turn a blind eye.<br><br>Yet nature's wrath, relentless in its might,<br>Storms brew, seas rise, ignoring the slight,<br>Climate change, a fact we must respect,<br>Before in denial, we all neglect.
