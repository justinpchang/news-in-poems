In Los Angeles, where the winds do howl,<br>Utilities face a scrutinizing scowl.<br>Experts ponder, was it a mistake to keep the power on high?<br>Risking fires in the fierce wind's cry.<br><br>Amidst the swaying trees and wild flames dance,<br>Critics question, was this a prudent chance?<br>In the city of angels, where power reigns supreme,<br>The gamble of leaving on the electricity, a risky scheme.<br><br>As embers spark, and smoke fills the sky,<br>The debate ignites, was safety passed by?<br>In the land of Hollywood dreams and sunny rays,<br>The decision to keep the power flowing, under fiery gaze.
