Oh, Princess Kate in a royal strife,<br>For editing a photo in her life,<br>A controversy in the realm of press,<br>A manipulated image causing much distress.<br><br>Innocent retouching turned askew,<br>Speculation swirls about what's true,<br>Her absence from the public eye,<br>Adds to the mystery, oh my, oh my.<br><br>A mother's day photo meant to delight,<br>Now removed from everyone's sight,<br>Her apology sincere and clear,<br>Yet whispers linger in the royal sphere. <br><br>Oh, Catherine, Princess of Wales fair,<br>Your editing mishap laid bare,<br>May this incident soon pass,<br>Leaving behind a royal class.
