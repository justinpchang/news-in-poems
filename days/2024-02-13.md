Ode to the Housing League<br><br>Oh, New York City, hear the call,<br>For a league of officials standing tall,<br>Against the crisis that plagues our land,<br>A shortage of homes, a demand in demand.<br><br>Antonio Reynoso, a leader in Brooklyn,<br>And Erik Bottcher, a voice in Manhattan's nooks,<br>Together they form a formidable team,<br>To tackle the housing crisis, or so it seems.<br><br>A league they create, a brave endeavor,<br>To welcome development and build together,<br>No more NIMBYs, those who oppose,<br>Let progress prevail, let homes arise and grow.<br><br>An invitation sent to all who serve,<br>160 politicians, let them gather and observe,<br>The urgency, the need, the time is now,<br>To bridge the gap, to make a vow.<br><br>Come, even if your doubts persist,<br>Open your minds, let skepticism twist,<br>For it is unity we seek to find,<br>In this League of Housing, close the divide.<br><br>No longer shall development be shunned,<br>For it is the solution, the chosen one,<br>A thriving city, where homes abound,<br>Where all can live, in harmony, profound.<br><br>Let the housing crisis be a distant past,<br>As we welcome progress and build fast,<br>The League of Housing, a beacon of hope,<br>A future where all can thrive and cope.
