In times of struggle, under watchful eye,<br>King Charles makes appearances humbly,<br>Greeting dignitaries with grace and sigh,<br>A symbol of unity and majesty.<br><br>---<br><br>At Easter service, his absence echoes loud,<br>As Camilla steps in, proudly taking the lead,<br>Bearing gifts to the deserving crowd,<br>While Charles, in spirit, attends with greater need.<br><br>---<br><br>An enigma shrouded in rumors untamed,<br>Speculations of his health in the air,<br>Yet through it all, his spirit remains unclaimed,<br>A monarch's resilience, beyond compare.<br><br>---<br><br>In the face of uncertainty and strife,<br>King Charles stands firm, embodying life's grace,<br>A beacon of hope in the royal tapestry of life,<br>Unyielding in his dignified embrace.
