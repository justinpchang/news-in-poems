Oh, gather 'round and hear the tale I spin <br>Of a man named Donald Trump, his world of sin <br>Indictment looming, his fate hanging high <br>A story of power, deceit, and a mighty fall from the sky <br><br>In realms of politics, he soared with pride <br>A businessman turned leader, taking a wild ride <br>But beneath the surface, shadows twirled <br>A cloud of controversy around a man who unfurled <br><br>His name echoed through the marble halls <br>Whispers of collusion, like unanswered calls <br>The prosecutor's gaze fixed upon his frame <br>Seeking justice, with no one left to blame <br><br>And so, the day of reckoning draws near <br>The indictment of Donald Trump, a moment of fear <br>Walls closing in, his secrets laid bare <br>As the world awaits a truth it cannot bear <br><br>But amidst the turmoil and the chaos untold <br>A nation divided, by stories that unfold <br>We must remember to stand united, so firm <br>For the truth shall prevail, unyielding and firm <br><br>Let us not forget the lessons we've learned <br>As we navigate through a world so churned <br>Where power corrupts and justice is sought <br>May integrity guide us, a beacon we've sought <br><br>So, as the story of Trump's indictment unfolds <br>Let us hope for justice, fearless and bold <br>For the truth shall prevail, the storm shall cease <br>In the pursuit of justice, may we find our peace.
