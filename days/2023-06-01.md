In the realm of politics, they vie,<br>The G.O.P. picked a cry,<br>Trans kids, they would say,<br>Are a threat, come what may,<br>Using fear to rally, oh my!<br><br>With words meant to stoke hate and divide,<br>They fanned flames, their intentions implied,<br>But amidst all the pain,<br>There's a truth that remains,<br>Trans kids deserve love, support, and pride.<br><br>For in these young souls, we must see,<br>Their right to choose who they want to be,<br>Their gender, their truth,<br>Shouldn't be used to abuse,<br>Instead, let's embrace diversity.<br><br>So let us stand strong, hand in hand,<br>For equality throughout the land,<br>Trans kids, they are brave,<br>And they too must be saved,<br>Inclusion and acceptance, the demand.<br><br>Though the G.O.P.'s cry may ring loud,<br>Trans kids will rise above the crowd,<br>With strength and resilience,<br>They'll shatter the silence,<br>And together, we'll make our voices proud.
