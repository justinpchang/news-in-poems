In the world of music, where guitars wail,<br>And drums reverberate through the night air,<br>Critics cry out, a gendered tale they unveil,<br>"The rock scene's a boys' club, do they really care?"<br><br>Yet in the hallowed halls of Slam Dunk fest,<br>Where melodies and lyrics intertwine,<br>Only two acts with women, a somber jest,<br>In a disparity that's not so benign.<br><br>Oh, rock and roll, where are the women's voices,<br>Amidst the sea of male-dominated choices?<br>In a world where music should be free,<br>Let the beat embrace diversity.
