Oh, Sea Cloud Spirit, a ship of grace,<br>With wind in her sails, she sets the pace,<br>In Mediterranean waters, she dances light,<br>A throwback to an elegant, bygone flight.<br><br>Wooden decks, a clipper design so rare,<br>The beauty of simplicity, beyond compare,<br>Amongst giants of the sea, she holds her own,<br>A reminder of a time long overthrown.<br><br>Passengers revel in her smaller size,<br>With 136 souls, beneath sunny skies,<br>A journey through history, on waves they roam,<br>On the Sea Cloud Spirit, find a place to call home.
