Oh, Nebraska,<br>Election votes in your hands,<br>Constitution's weight.<br><br>Unique system,<br>Revealing flaws in our laws,<br>Fix them, or we'll fall.<br><br>The people wait,<br>For change to come swiftly,<br>Or chaos will reign.<br><br>United we stand,<br>Divided we may crumble,<br>Nebraska speaks loud.
