In Wiltshire, a therapist's slaps, oh so bold,<br>Cut short the life of a lady so old.<br>No zen and no peace,<br>Just pain that won't cease,<br>A tragic tale that leaves hearts cold. <br><br>A workshop where slapping caused harm,<br>Left Danielle without a chance to disarm.<br>Her life was cut short,<br>No more to cavort,<br>In the hands of a therapist's alarm.<br><br>A practice thought to heal and aid,<br>Turned out to be where danger laid.<br>With slaps so severe,<br>Life disappeared,<br>In the quest for wellness, a price was paid.
