In Russia, shadows linger, whispers spread wide,<br>As Navalny's death prompts questions to abide.<br>A voice against power, silenced in despair,<br>As suspicions bloom, envelop the air.<br><br>Authorities extend their reach and hold,<br>Blocking views, mysteries still untold.<br>His mother, seeking solace in his sight,<br>Denied access, in the shadows of the night.<br><br>The truth obscured, veiled behind closed doors,<br>While critics rally, demanding more.<br>They push, they pry, seeking to reveal,<br>The secrets that the darkness tries to conceal.<br><br>Oh, Navalny, your voice echoes strong and clear,<br>In the hearts of many, your message sincere.<br>In the face of injustice, you stood tall,<br>Now in your absence, we hear your call.
