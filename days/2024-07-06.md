O Robert Towne, a legend we mourn,<br>Whose words in films were brilliantly sworn,<br>"Chinatown" shines bright in history's eyes,<br>A gem of cinema that forever flies.<br><br>In scripts of depth and intricate thought,<br>Towne's talent and skill were finely wrought,<br>Oscar in hand, his words carved with precision,<br>Crafting stories that sparked our imagination's vision.<br><br>A master of dialogue, a maestro of the pen,<br>In Hollywood's vast realm, he did transcend,<br>Robert Towne's legacy, an eternal flame,<br>His brilliance in screenwriting, we'll always acclaim.
