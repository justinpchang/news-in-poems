In tribute to rhythms, lost beats now resigned,<br>Two Bee Gees drummers now forever twined,<br>Colin and Dennis, beating hearts of sound,<br>Their legacy in music shall resound.<br><br>One played in disco's shimmering array,<br>The other with the band right from the start,<br>Their beats entwined, forever to convey,<br>A rhythm unbroken, a drumming heart.<br><br>In harmony they played, their souls engaged,<br>Each beat a story, each rhythm aligned,<br>Now in the heavens, their drums are staged,<br>A legacy in music left behind.<br><br>Two Bee Gees drummers, side by side they lie,<br>In tunes eternal, they shall never die.
