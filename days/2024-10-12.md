In Virginia's fields of politics, a battle rages,<br>Votes plucked like ripe fruit, from history's pages.<br>Youngkin's order, a swipe of the pen so bold,<br>Justice cries out; the truth must be told.<br><br>Across the land, the drum of democracy beats,<br>As voices rise against unlawful deceit.<br>In the shadows of power, where lies take their toll,<br>Virginia stands strong, defending each soul.<br><br>With the scales of fairness, the law must align,<br>No room for injustice, no place for decline.<br>Eagle-eyed Justice, vigilant and true,<br>In the dance of democracy, she'll see it all through.
