In the halls of power, a mother's voice rings clear,<br>Accusing her own son, her words sincere.<br>A family drama, laid bare for all to see,<br>A tale of mistreatment, echoing through history.<br><br>Yet regret now lingers in the air,<br>Apologies offered, to show she cares.<br>A mother's love, a tangled web,<br>In the midst of scandal, where hearts are led.<br><br>Through email's thread, the truth unfurls,<br>Of mistreatment and contentious whirls.<br>A son's actions, under the spotlight's gleam,<br>As family secrets disrupt the dream.<br><br>But in the end, forgiveness may find its way,<br>A mother's love, not led astray.<br>In the arena of public shame,<br>A son and mother, linked in familial name.
