In Montana's vast expanse, wildfires fiercely burn,<br>Consuming acres of trees, leaving devastation in turn.<br>The once lush forests now reduced to mere ash,<br>Leaving ranchers and landowners in despair and cash.<br><br>As Don Harland surveys his Sheep Creek Ranch with dread,<br>He knows the forest won't come back from the dead.<br>The dry summers have turned once thriving pines into fuel,<br>Leaving behind a scorched landscape, cruel.<br><br>But a glimmer of hope arises from the charred land,<br>A company named Mast extends a helping hand.<br>They pledge to replant and restore the forest's grace,<br>Offsetting carbon emissions, a noble embrace.<br><br>In a dance of nature's destruction and human strife,<br>Companies strive to rebuild the tree supply chain's life.<br>From Montana's flames to Seattle's green initiative,<br>A tale of resilience in a world so combative.
