In shadows lurked Tim Pearson, Adams' right hand,<br>With secrets deep in city's murky land,<br>Migrant shelters, contracts, a corrupt demand,<br>Now investigations force him to disband.<br><br>His ties to power, a web so well-spun,<br>But now the truth reveals what he has done,<br>In Mayor Adams' circle, he had won,<br>Yet corruption beneath the shining sun.<br><br>Oh, Tim Pearson, advisor turned to dust,<br>Influence wielded, now crumbles with trust,<br>Amid the chaos, scandals, he is thrust,<br>As city's heartache leaves him in the dust.<br><br>Farewell to Pearson, once held in high regard,<br>Now tarnished reputation, deeply scarred,<br>In Adams' realm, corruption stands unbarred,<br>As investigations leave a city jarred.
