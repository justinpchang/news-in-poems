<p>
In the strife of the Middle East, they contend,
<br />
Rockets soared, a conflict without an end.
<br />
Gaza witnessed the withdrawal of the might,
<br />
As the IDF shifted gears in the deep of the night.
</p>
<p>
Artsakh faded away, its existence to suspend,
<br />
A decree signed, a chapter brought to an end.
</p>
