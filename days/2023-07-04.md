There once was a moon oh so bright,<br>That gave stargazers quite a delight.<br>Closer than it should be,<br>A supermoon, you see,<br>With hues of amber and red, what a sight!<br><br>From Los Angeles to Istanbul's border,<br>People ran out to the streets in disorder.<br>For the first time this year,<br>A supermoon did appear,<br>And it left all the viewers in wonder.<br><br>Bigger and brighter it did shine,<br>A sight that was truly divine.<br>Coined by Richard Nolle,<br>With no need to cajole,<br>A supermoon is simply sublime.<br><br>So let us all gaze at the sky,<br>And watch as the moon passes us by.<br>For a supermoon's grace,<br>Fills our hearts with embrace,<br>And takes us on a celestial high.
