In Lebanon, African workers wait in fear,<br>Their future uncertain, danger drawing near.<br>Stuck in a country, their hearts full of dread,<br>Panicked and trapped, with war's shadow overhead.<br><br>Their thoughts consumed by worries deep,<br>In Lebanon's turmoil, their worries steep.<br>Dreams of home, a distant memory,<br>Trapped in a land that may soon be unwary.<br><br>Africans in Lebanon, courage they must find,<br>In a country where peace seems far behind.<br>Praying for safety, a flicker of hope they seek,<br>In a world where their voices are often meek.
