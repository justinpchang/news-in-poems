In Manhattan’s Chinatown, anger brews, dismay,<br>A looming jail project casts shadows its way.<br>The demolition roars, the dust clouds rise high,<br>Residents protest, they raise their battle cry.<br><br>The noise, the cracks, the dust, a daily plight,<br>Businesses falter, struggling in the fight.<br>With reduced foot traffic, concerns arise,<br>As the shadows of uncertainty seize the skies.<br><br>Community groups unite, against this jail so tall,<br>Demanding accountability, they stand tall.<br>For the Tombs’ remnants to pave the way,<br>Locals voice dissent, pleading for a better day.<br><br>Bracing for disruption, yearslong in scope,<br>The future uncertain, filled with grim hope.<br>Chinatown’s outcry, echoes loud and clear,<br>Against the jail project they hold dear.
