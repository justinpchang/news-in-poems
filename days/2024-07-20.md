Oh Blinken, with confidence you speak,<br>Claiming victory is within our reach.<br>A Gaza cease-fire, just 'round the bend,<br>An end to strife, let peace descend.<br><br>Sullivan, cautious, mindful and wise,<br>Advising patience as time flies.<br>Netanyahu's visit stirs the air,<br>Will diplomacy reign, banish despair?<br><br>In the game of peace, they near the goal,<br>Yet obstacles may take their toll.<br>Let's hope for a touchdown, a final score,<br>Where conflict ends forevermore.
