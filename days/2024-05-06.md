In a world where politics mix with pets,<br>A governor's views may cause some upsets.<br>To suggest a dog should meet its end,<br>Seems extreme to those who defend.<br><br>Experts advise a different route,<br>To train, to love, and not to refute.<br>Euthanasia, a last resort we're told,<br>A peaceful passing for the old.<br><br>So let us cherish our furry friends,<br>Their loyalty and love they always lend.<br>For when a good dog goes astray,<br>Patience and care should guide the way.<br><br>Though differences in opinions may arise,<br>Let kindness and compassion be the prize.<br>For in the end, a dog's pure heart,<br>Is an eternal work of art.
