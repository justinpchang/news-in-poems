In Komyshivka, the soldiers did dwell,<br>Surrounded by troops, in a tense swell,<br>But with courage and might,<br>They escaped in the night,<br>Their escape a heroic tale to retell.<br><br>Through fields they moved, silent and sly,<br>Under the moonlit, vast Ukrainian sky,<br>Evading the Russian hand,<br>Fleeing their besieged land,<br>Their bravery and wits helped them fly.<br><br>With nerves of steel, they broke free,<br>From the clutches of that enemy spree,<br>Their story now told,<br>Of the brave and the bold,<br>In Komyshivka, where they fought to be free.
