In London's streets, a girl did dwell,<br>With dreams she bid her home farewell,<br>To Syria's lands of strife and dread,<br>She journeyed on where blood was shed.<br><br>A girl no more but stained in sin,<br>Her citizenship, they would win,<br>Stripped away, she's left forlorn,<br>In a land where hope is torn.<br><br>A refugee in a foreign land,<br>Stateless now, with none to stand,<br>Her fate hangs in the legal fray,<br>As she pleads to come back one day.
