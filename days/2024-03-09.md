In the land of Ontario, where gambling ads do swarm,<br>Celebrities and athletes were once the norm,<br>But the province decided, it was time for a change,<br>To protect its people, a decision so strange.<br><br>No more Wayne Gretzky or Matthews in sight,<br>Their faces no longer adorning the night,<br>A call to end the ads, a new era begins,<br>As Ontario looks out for its kith and its kins.<br><br>With sports betting on the rise, temptation's call,<br>Ontarians beware, don't let yourself fall,<br>For 79 online sites await at your hand,<br>But with new rules in place, they must take a stand.<br><br>So farewell to the ads that once ruled the screen,<br>Celebrity faces no longer seen,<br>Ontario paves the way for a market more fair,<br>A step in the right direction, a path of care.
