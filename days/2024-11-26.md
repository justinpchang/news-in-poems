In Georgia, where the peaches grow,<br>A factory stands, a new tableau,<br>With federal loans, it starts to show,<br>An eco-friendly status quo.<br><br>A push for change, a climate call,<br>To counter Trump's expected stall,<br>With $13 billion to enthrall,<br>Sustainable dreams may now stand tall.<br><br>Green energy, the future's key,<br>In Georgia's factory, we see,<br>A glimpse of what the world could be,<br>Thanks to loans from the powers that be.<br><br>As policies shift, a race against time,<br>To combat carbon's uphill climb,<br>Innovative projects start to chime,<br>A brighter future, an optimistic rhyme.
