In hospitals, hope flickers, a silent plea for life,<br>Organ donors scarce in a world of strife and strife.<br>Can we not look beyond, to give a piece of ourselves,<br>A gift of love, a chance for one to break free from shelves.<br><br>Families wrestle with the choice, a heavy burden to bear,<br>To donate or not, in a moment of despair.<br>Yet in their hands lies a thread of hope, a chance to save a life,<br>To turn the darkness into dawn, amidst the turmoil and strife.<br><br>Blank stares haunt the corridors, patients fade away in wait,<br>As consent rates drop, sealing a tragic fate.<br>But in each beating heart, a rhythm of generosity lies,<br>A symphony of compassion, a chance to let love rise.<br><br>So let us not falter, in the face of fear and doubt,<br>But embrace the beauty of giving, let the organ donation shout.<br>For in each refusal, a life's potential fades away,<br>Let's unite in kindness, let's donate and let hope sway.
