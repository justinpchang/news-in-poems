In South Africa, ambulances face attack,<br>No reverence left, just a cruel act.<br>Paramedics brave, their mission clear,<br>Facing danger and scorn, hearts filled with fear.<br><br>Through the Red Zone they race, sirens wail,<br>Thieves target them, no mercy prevail.<br>Phones, wallets taken, a dangerous spree,<br>Respect eroded, where safety should be free.<br><br>In Cape Town's streets, a risky affair,<br>Ambulance crews face a constant scare.<br>No honor given, no safe respite,<br>Just bravery shining in the midst of this plight.<br><br>In the chaos of crime, they stand strong,<br>Heroes of the night, amid all wrong.<br>Their courage shines, a beacon bright,<br>In a world where respect takes a flight.
