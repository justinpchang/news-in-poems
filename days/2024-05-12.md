In Rafah's dusty streets, the hospital doors now closed,<br>As Israel's forceful hand in shadowed conflict posed,<br>People scatter, flee from harm, with fear and chaos sown,<br>A somber dance of war and grief in this familiar zone.<br><br>Aid workers rush to aid the exodus of worried minds,<br>In Rafah's main hospital, compassion hard to find,<br>The wounded, scared, and lost in search of safety near,<br>As violence brews, so stark, so cruel, in Gaza, a land of fear.<br><br>The world looks on, in silence, as this tragedy unfolds,<br>In Rafah's streets where stories of despair are told,<br>Yet hope still flickers, dimly, in the darkest of nights,<br>As bravery shines through the chaos, in these relentless fights. <br><br>Oh Rafah, torn by conflict's hand, we weep for you tonight,<br>As families flee and homes collapse in the ever-growing blight,<br>May peace find solace in your land, may healing start to bloom,<br>In Rafah's heart, may love persist and banish all the gloom.
