Oh, majestic national parks divine,<br>Where nature's beauty and splendor shine,<br>Campaigners now a clarion call declare,<br>For parkland in public hands to have a care.<br><br>Let's give these sanctuaries room to grow,<br>With powers to buy land, let nature's gifts show,<br>To protect habitats and creatures rare,<br>In harmony, the land and wildlife pair.<br><br>So let the parks be nature's cherished keeper,<br>Preserving landscapes, rivers, and forests deeper,<br>For generations to come to delight and explore,<br>In these havens, nature's wonders to adore.
