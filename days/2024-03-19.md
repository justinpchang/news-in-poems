In the heart of Hong Kong's city so bright,<br>Article 23 now fogs the once-clear sight,<br>With laws so harsh, dissent they try to smite,<br>Eroding freedoms, casting a shadow at height.<br><br>Gaps in security, a reason they proclaim,<br>To stifle opposition, tarnish democracyâ€™s name,<br>In a former colony, once known for its flame,<br>The spirit of resistance now faces a fierce game.<br><br>From British hands, the city did pass,<br>With promises grand, but now, alas,<br>National security laws like a menacing mass,<br>Threatening freedoms, turning the hourglass.<br><br>Facing adversity, the people must stand,<br>Against oppressive laws tightening hand,<br>In Hong Kong's story, a turning of the sand,<br>May freedom prevail, reclaim its land.
