In Paris, a woman dared to fly away,<br>Svetlana Dali, a renegade they say,<br>Cutting off her monitor, she did defy,<br>Boarding a bus, on the run to the sky.<br><br>Across oceans and borders, her tale unfurls,<br>Seeking freedom as her brave spirit whirls,<br>Eager to escape, to a place so grand,<br>Fleeing on wheels towards Canada's land.<br><br>But the long arm of the law won't let her rest,<br>Chasing her dreams, towards the North she pressed,<br>A modern-day fugitive on the run,<br>Flying from justice, under the sun.
