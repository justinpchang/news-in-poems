In a concrete cell she sat, for a joint sold in jest,<br>A young woman's fate, put to the ultimate test.<br>Once a simple gesture among friends so carefree,<br>Now six months of rehab, a grim reality.<br><br>No more laughter shared over a puff of smoke,<br>Just the harsh echoes of concrete that silently spoke.<br>Her freedom stripped, her future left in doubt,<br>For a single act, consequences played out.<br><br>In a world where laws clash with personal choice,<br>She's caught in the web, with a weak, muffled voice.<br>A lesson learned hard in the shadow of bars,<br>As she counts each day under the watchful guards.<br><br>In a system where justice may seem quite askew,<br>A young woman's story, a warning so true.<br>The price of a joint, a heavy toll to pay,<br>In a concrete cell, her dreams fade away.<br><br>So beware of the choices that you may make,<br>For a simple act can lead to a severe mistake.<br>In the dim, cold walls of a rehab cell,<br>Her tale of caution, a somber warning to tell.
