In Manchester, nerves were frayed, hearts in a bind,<br>City faced Brugge in a match of a special kind.<br>Champions League aspirations hanging by a thread,<br>Avoiding humiliation was the fear that led.<br><br>Improvement is needed, that sharpness, that spark,<br>To make the last 16, to venture into the dark.<br>Real Madrid or Bayern Munich await the fate,<br>Man City must rise, they cannot be late.<br><br>Oh the drama, the tension, in the footballing air,<br>Fans holding their breath, grasping at prayer.<br>City's fate hangs in the balance, a delicate dance,<br>Turning dreams of glory into a real chance.
