In the realm of Corporate America and Joe,<br>He courts, yet he lashes, a curious show.<br>With profits soaring high,<br>And policies that make some executives sigh,<br>It's a dance of love and hate that they both know.<br><br>From tax incentives to strategic plans,<br>Biden tries to win them, extending his hands.<br>But Republicans scoff,<br>At these moves, they do not turn off,<br>Calling it all simply "corporate welfare" lands.<br><br>So in this complicated affair they share,<br>Will they clash or find a way to repair?<br>Only time will tell,<br>As they navigate this intricate spell,<br>In the business and politics affair.
