In shadows deep, a group of magic folk dwell,<br>Their powers unmatched, a story they tell,<br>No battles fierce or villains to assail,<br>But white tears they soothe, their powers prevail.<br><br>Their mission clear, to comfort and appease,<br>To mend what's broken, and put minds at ease,<br>With keen perception, they see the inner frets,<br>And through their magic, white worries they abet.<br><br>In a world where roles are often skewed,<br>They stand as symbols, their powers shrewd,<br>A critique profound, a satirical jest,<br>On race relations, they put it to the test.<br><br>So watch as they weave their mystical threads,<br>In Kobi Libii's tale, where irony treads,<br>A glance into a world quite surreal,<br>Where magical Negroes white tears heal.
