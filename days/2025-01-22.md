In a land of sand and strife they sought<br>A glimmer of hope, a refuge, a port,<br>But instead, they faced a living hell,<br>In Libya, where unspeakable stories dwell.<br><br>Through the echoes of war, they fled,<br>To find themselves in mercy's stead,<br>But met with cruelty so vile,<br>Their shattered souls left to reconcile.<br><br>In the shadows of the desert night,<br>Their cries unheard, their tears take flight,<br>As violence and abuse reign supreme,<br>In a world where nightmares gleam.<br><br>Oh, Sudanese women, in silence you bear,<br>The scars of horror, the weight of despair,<br>May your voices rise, may justice ignite,<br>And in the darkness, find a flicker of light.
