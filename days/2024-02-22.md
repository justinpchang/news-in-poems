In Britain's southwest, a dome of rust,<br>Hinkley Point C, a plant robust.<br>A crane hoists high, a monumental feat,<br>Nuclear power, a future to greet.<br><br>Years pass by, construction drags on,<br>Delays plague, costs now begone.<br>Électricité de France, a warning sound,<br>Completion distant, the project bound.<br><br>The first since the nineties, a nuclear tale,<br>Hinkley Point struggles, the industry frail.<br>A concrete saucer, a symbol in the land,<br>A reminder of challenges, as delays expand.<br><br>Oh, Hinkley Point, a goal in sight,<br>Yet time and money continue their fight.<br>A flagship project, a dream awry,<br>Nuclear power, under the British sky.
