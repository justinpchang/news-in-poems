In the land where cherry blossoms dance and sway,  <br>A star was born, shining bright during the day,  <br>With melodies sweet, her voice would serenade,  <br>In hearts of fans, her legacy never to fade.  <br><br>Oh, Miho Nakayama, a true shining star,  <br>In songs and on screen, you've traveled afar,  <br>Your spirit lives on through each melody's hum,  <br>In the hearts of your fans, forever to drum.  <br><br>With every note sung and every scene acted,  <br>Your talent and grace, forever impacted,  <br>From teenage stardom to awards well-deserved,  <br>In memories and hearts, eternally preserved.  <br><br>Farewell to a legend, gone too soon,  <br>Through music and movies, under the moon,  <br>Your legacy lives on, a shimmering light,  <br>Guiding us through the darkest of night.
