In Rafah's streets, the tanks now roam,<br>Tensions rise in this war-torn home.<br>Will peace prevail or will it crack,<br>As Gazans fear another attack?<br><br>In Cairo, talks of cease-fire ignite,<br>While Israeli tanks disrupt the night.<br>A million souls displaced in dread,<br>Praying for safety, fearing the red. <br><br>In Rafah's skies, the stars dim low,<br>As violence threatens to overflow.<br>Will diplomacy find its way,<br>Or will conflict lead the day?<br><br>Oh, Gaza, besieged and worn,<br>In the shadows of tanks, torn.<br>May peace descend like a gentle dove,<br>And wrap you in its endless love.
