In October, the leaves may fall,<br>But fear not, for there's a call,<br>To read these books, so new and grand,<br>That will whisk you to distant lands.<br><br>First on the list, a tale so deep,<br>"The Maniac", it makes you weep,<br>Benjam√≠n Labatut takes the lead,<br>A story of genius, dark indeed.<br><br>John von Neumann, a man of might,<br>His mind a beacon, shining bright,<br>Through physics, economics, he did roam,<br>Leaving behind a scholarly tome.<br><br>The Manhattan Project, his claim to fame,<br>A secret endeavor, hidden in shame,<br>Yet Labatut brings it to light,<br>Through imagined remembrances, day and night.<br><br>Colleagues, associates, and loved ones too,<br>Their voices tell a story, oh so true,<br>Of a hyper-rational mind, it seems,<br>That slipped into darkness, beyond our dreams.<br><br>Imagine the scenes as they unfold,<br>A brilliant mind, trapped in a mold,<br>A study of genius, and its cost,<br>In "The Maniac," the lines are crossed.
