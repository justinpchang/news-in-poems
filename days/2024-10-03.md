In a world where shadows dance with fear,<br>Where echoes of gunfire linger near,<br>Young Gus, amidst chaos and fright,<br>Stood tall and guided others to light.<br><br>A father's heart aches with sorrow so deep,<br>As his son faced nightmares in his sleep,<br>A shooting's aftermath, a community's pain,<br>Yet in the darkness, a hero did reign.<br><br>Through the smoke and the deafening cries,<br>Gus, a beacon with determined eyes,<br>His courage shining amidst the shroud,<br>Protecting young souls, valiant and proud.<br><br>In the face of tragedy and despair,<br>A boy's bravery, beyond compare,<br>A tale of hope in a moment of dread,<br>Young Gus, a hero, where angels tread.
