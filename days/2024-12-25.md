In Newcastle's cathedral tall and grand,<br>Bishop Hartley's words make a stand,<br>"Archbishop's Christmas sermon so hollow,<br>Empty words ring, no solace to follow."<br><br>With fervor, she spoke of resignation,<br>Calling out in righteous indignation,<br>For truth and substance, she did yearn,<br>In the season where hearts should learn.<br><br>Amidst the carols and candle's glow,<br>Bishop's voice resolute did flow,<br>No mincing words in her refrain,<br>Challenging preaching that's in vain.<br><br>So in the cathedral's hallowed space,<br>Bishop's message filled with grace,<br>A plea for words sincere and true,<br>To guide the faithful, old and new.
