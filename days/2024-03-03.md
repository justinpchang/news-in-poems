In the throes of life, we sway and we wade,<br>Statistics shaping choices we have made.<br>At thirty-three, we peak, the trend we set,<br>Molding the economy like a silhouette.<br><br>In 2009, we flooded through the gates,<br>College-bound in droves, altering the fates.<br>Urban jungles called, we answered loud and clear,<br>Millennials carving paths, year by year.<br><br>Debts piled high, student loans a heavy load,<br>Yellow-painted closets, our humble abode.<br>Housing dreams fulfilled, a united spree,<br>At thirty-three, we steer the economy.
