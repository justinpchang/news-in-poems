In the heart of New Orleans, tragedy struck,<br>Bourbon Street tainted by a deadly luck,<br>Fourteen souls lost in a truck's ruthless attack,<br>Leaving a city in mourning, on a dark, grim track.<br><br>Mardi Gras dreams replaced by terror's cold embrace,<br>As New Orleans seeks answers, trying to trace<br>How to prevent such horror, this senseless pain,<br>Can security measures keep us safe, keep danger at bay?<br><br>Counterterrorism minds ponder, strategize,<br>Seeking to shield against evil's guise,<br>In the echoes of chaos, a city stands strong,<br>Picking up the pieces, refusing to be undone.
