Oh, universities with walls so high,<br>Accused of letting standards die,<br>For students who, from lands afar,<br>Bring with them funds, like a shining star.<br><br>No concerns arise, they claim with might,<br>As foreign students reach the light,<br>Their grades may differ, but have no fear,<br>For their fees bring riches near.<br><br>A blend of cultures, minds entwined,<br>In lecture halls, wisdom to find,<br>Critics may scoff at lowered bars,<br>But universities see bright stars.
