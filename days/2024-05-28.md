In realms where hope's flame brightly ignites,<br>Melinda Gates champions women's rights,<br>Philanthropy spreads its wings to take flight,<br>In her gaze, equality shines ever so bright.<br><br>In countries far and near, her work takes root,<br>Empowering voices that were long kept mute,<br>Abortion rights she advocates, resolute,<br>A beacon of change, in her truth absolute.<br><br>May her efforts bold, like a river flow,<br>Through barriers and judgments, breaking the status quo,<br>In a world where freedoms ebb and grow,<br>Melinda French Gates, a force to know.
