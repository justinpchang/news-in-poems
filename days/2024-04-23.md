In the heart of Hong Kong, a footballing tale,<br>Where fans cheered loud and booed the prevailing gale,<br>The national anthem, a source of strife,<br>Voicing frustrations, defining a life.<br><br>Security tightened, banners seized,<br>Fifa fines looming, freedoms squeezed,<br>Hong Kong's identity, a delicate dance,<br>Caught between China's powerful stance.<br><br>With CSL's rise, tensions grew,<br>World-famous players, clubs anew,<br>Amidst the chaos, Hong Kong stood strong,<br>A symbol of resistance, singing its own song.<br><br>Yet the dilemma persists, a game of power,<br>Where football meets politics, hour by hour,<br>In the streets of Hong Kong, the dragon crest gleams,<br>A nation divided, caught in two extremes.
