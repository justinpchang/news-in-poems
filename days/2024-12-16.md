In the heart of rhythms, with hands quick and deft,<br>Zakir Hussain's tabla played, a master with finesse,<br>Across lands he journeyed, his beats a celestial caress,<br>A legacy left behind, for music's eternal quest.<br><br>In India's embrace, his talent did bloom,<br>A maestro of the tabla, dispelling gloom,<br>With each resonant strike, a story did loom,<br>Zakir Hussain, in our hearts, forever to zoom.<br><br>On global stages, his melodies did soar,<br>Unleashing emotions never felt before,<br>A virtuoso of rhythm, with a soul so pure,<br>Zakir Hussain, now a legend, evermore.<br><br>In concert halls and echoes of the past,<br>We hear the tabla's rhythm, it will forever last,<br>Zakir Hussain's spirit, in music steadfast,<br>A maestro departed, to the heavens vast.
