In New Zealand's land of green and gold,<br>A king has passed, his story told,<br>Tuhetia, MƒÅori leader strong,<br>His spirit soars, with ancestors long.<br><br>Amidst the hills and rivers wide,<br>He ruled with wisdom, never to hide,<br>His legacy, a shining light,<br>Guiding hearts through darkest night.<br><br>With family near, his final breath,<br>In peaceful rest, he met with death,<br>A king now gone to join the stars,<br>In lands beyond, no earthly bars.<br><br>Farewell, great king, your memory bright,<br>Your spirit dances in the night,<br>New Zealand mourns, a nation weeps,<br>As Tuhetia in eternal slumber sleeps.
