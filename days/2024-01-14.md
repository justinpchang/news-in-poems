In winter's chill, a frosty blast arrives,<br>As sub-zero wind chills blanket the land.<br>From Montana to the western Dakotas,<br>The icy grip tightens its frozen hand.<br><br>Minus seventy, a numbing, bitter cold,<br>A frigid touch that bites right to the bone.<br>The Great Lakes, beaming with ethereal white,<br>As snowflakes dance and twirl in grace alone.<br><br>The Northeast, where snow squalls may descend,<br>With winter's fury, nature's frozen breath.<br>And on the West Coast, rain and sleet shall fall,<br>As icy winds whip through from coast to coast.<br><br>Oh, dangerous storm, relentless and fierce,<br>A holiday weekend cloaked in freezing air.<br>With gales that howl and winds that chill the soul,<br>A tempest that demands our utmost care.<br><br>Prepare, oh traveler, for this icy plight,<br>A cold survival kit to aid your way.<br>For frostbite and hypothermia lurk,<br>In every frozen step we take today.<br><br>But midst the freeze, a beauty still remains,<br>In white-capped mountains and snow-covered plains.<br>A winter wonderland, a glistening sight,<br>Where nature paints a masterpiece with might.
