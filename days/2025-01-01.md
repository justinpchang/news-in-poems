In sorrow's embrace,<br>Lessons from dark depths emerge,<br>Guiding light within.<br><br>Through tears and through pain,<br>Mother's wisdom still remains,<br>Echoes of her love.<br><br>Whispers in the wind,<br>Lessons learned, a heart transformed,<br>In loss, we find strength.<br><br>Gone yet ever near,<br>A mother's love endures time,<br>Lessons from the heart.
