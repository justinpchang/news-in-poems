In Sark's embrace, the children roamed,<br>Excitement radiated as they strolled back home.<br>Their eyes glittered with wonder and glee,<br>To witness a majestic whale emerging from the sea.<br><br>Its colossal size took their breath away,<br>A gentle giant making a grand display.<br>The children's screams echoed with delight,<br>As nature's spectacle filled them with pure light.<br><br>In sync with the waves, the whale danced,<br>A graceful waltz that the children enhanced.<br>Their voices harmonized in joyous cheer,<br>A memory etched in their hearts, crystal clear.<br><br>Oh, the magic of youth intertwined with the sea,<br>In awe of a whale, wild and free.<br>Their spirits lifted by this grand sight,<br>As their laughter echoed into the twilight's light.
