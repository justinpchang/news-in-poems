In somber tones they print today,<br>Of a legend lost along the way.<br>With each paper turned, stories unfold,<br>Of a man admired for goalposts he patrolled.<br><br>---<br><br>No sorrow, they say, just show a grin,<br>Celebrate the victories he did win.<br>Though pages filled with his life's tale,<br>His legacy in every football tale.<br><br>---<br><br>Yet in the corner, a different tale told,<br>Of children anxious, shattered, bold.<br>A staggering rise in fear and fret,<br>Their young hearts heavy with the threat.<br><br>---<br><br>While headlines scream of sports fame,<br>In quiet corners, anxiety claims its aim.<br>A contrast stark, on front pages bound,<br>Life's joys and struggles, forever round.
