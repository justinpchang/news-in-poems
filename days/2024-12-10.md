In Worcester town, where darkness may seep,<br>Justice Departmentâ€™s eyes now take a peep.<br>Police misconduct, a shameful defeat,<br>Where power corrupts and innocence they mistreat.<br><br>Undercover officers, shadows they blend,<br>In the night, with a mission to pretend.<br>Luring women, suspected of selling pleasure,<br>In the arms of the law, they find no treasure.<br><br>Excessive force, a weapon misused,<br>In the land where justice feels abused.<br>Women silenced, their voices unheard,<br>In Worcester, a place where trust is blurred.<br><br>The streets whisper secrets of unspoken pain,<br>As the Justice Department starts its campaign.<br>To uncover the truths that lie beneath,<br>In a city where corruption seethes.
