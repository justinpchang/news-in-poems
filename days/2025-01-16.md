In New York court they stand, the Alexander Brothers three,<br>Oren, Tal, and Alon, facing charges and plea,<br>Accused of crimes so grievous, they're deemed a flight risk,<br>Their fate sealed in a prison cell, justice's iron fist.<br><br>From Miami to New York, they'll be brought to stand trial,<br>No bail for them, the judge decrees with a smile,<br>Federal detention their new abode, a cold and dreary place,<br>Awaiting justice's verdict, their future they must face.<br><br>Behind bars they'll ponder their choices, their fates entwined,<br>No escape from the consequences, justice now defined,<br>The Alexander Brothers, once high in wealth and sway,<br>Now face the music, in a courtroom they must stay.<br><br>Their tale a cautionary one, of power and its cost,<br>In the end, the scales of justice always rule and exhaust,<br>No more flights for these brothers, their wings firmly clipped,<br>In the eyes of the law, no more escapes are scripted.
