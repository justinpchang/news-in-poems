In shadows lurked a plan, with malice, dark and bent,<br>A figure with ill intent, on chaos, death was set,<br>But in the twist of fate, the hand of justice found,<br>A suspect now in chains, their wicked plot unwound.<br><br>In corridors of power, where secrets echo loud,<br>A threat against a leader, a nation left unbowed,<br>Yet from the shadows cast, where danger sought to tread,<br>The light of truth emerged, exposing fear and dread.<br><br>In the land of stars and stripes, where freedom's flame still burns,<br>A momentary pause, as the world around it turns,<br>With hearts in solemn prayer, for peace to reign and mend,<br>The tale of this dark hour, a caution and a friend.
