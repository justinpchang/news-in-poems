In a castle nestled 'neath ancient trees,<br>Yves Gastou lived out his fantasies,<br>A refuge of history and treasures untold,<br>A place frozen in time, a sight to behold.<br><br>Within the castle's crenelated walls so grand,<br>Gastou's eclectic tastes took a stand,<br>Midcentury Cubist furniture adorned the space,<br>Echoes of the past, an enchanting embrace.<br><br>A follylike fortress, a summer retreat,<br>Where knights and romance did sweetly meet,<br>The hermitage whispers tales of days gone by,<br>A collector's paradise beneath the azure sky.<br><br>Amidst bamboo and oak, a faded facade stands tall,<br>A haven for memories that never fall,<br>Yves Gastou's legacy, a castle's charm,<br>Preserved in time, safe from all harm.
