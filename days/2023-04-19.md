In the highest court of the land,<br>Abortion takes a stand.<br>A battle of beliefs, so grand,<br>As the debate is now at hand.<br><br>Pro-choice and Pro-life, both locked in a fight,<br>With arguments fierce, like daggers in the night.<br>The Supreme Court hears their pleas with scrutinizing sight,<br>Deciding the fate of women's reproductive rights.<br><br>Justices gather, robes flowing in the breeze,<br>As the arguments echo through the chamber with ease.<br>The weight of their decision, heavy as the seas,<br>As they ponder the balance between liberty and unease.<br><br>The scales of justice teeter on a thin wire,<br>As emotions rise, fueled by passion and fire.<br>Each side making claims they aspire,<br>To shape the future with their desires.<br><br>But in the end, a ruling will be made,<br>And the repercussions will cascade.<br>For the millions of women, their lives at stake,<br>Their choices hanging in the balance, no mistake.<br><br>As the gavel falls and the verdict is cast,<br>The future of women's rights will be amassed.<br>A milestone decision, sure to last,<br>In the pages of history, deeply etched, steadfast.<br><br>So, let us wait, with bated breath,<br>For the Supreme Court to make its bet.<br>And as the world watches, full of unrest,<br>May justice prevail, and the truth manifest.
