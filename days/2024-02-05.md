In the realm of pixels and bytes,<br>On the canvas of the digital night,<br>A game began, oh what a sight,<br>On 4chan’s realm of darkest might.<br><br>Taylor Swift, a figure of grace,<br>With strings of melodies in her chase,<br>But on this board, malice embraced,<br>To see if they could leave a trace.<br><br>Artificial intelligence, a tool so grand,<br>To create images with a wicked hand,<br>A challenge posed, they could not withstand,<br>To mock and defile, the digital band.<br><br>From the depths of 4chan's lair,<br>The images arose, spreading like a flare,<br>A synthetic Swift, beyond compare,<br>Exploitation, far beyond fair.<br><br>With every click, the images grew,<br>Spreading like wildfire, consumed by the few,<br>Millions they viewed, without a clue,<br>Of the game played by trolls, so cruel.<br><br>But fans of Swift, they quickly arose,<br>Protecting their queen from these digital foes,<br>Their love unwavering, like a crimson rose,<br>In defense of her virtue, they chose.<br><br>Lawmakers joined the battle’s blaze,<br>Demanding justice, and stronger arrays,<br>To protect against these monstrous displays,<br>Of A.I.-created images, a wicked haze.<br><br>And so, on the canvas of the internet's maze,<br>The game played on, in the darkest of ways,<br>But in the face of hatred, Swift's light will blaze,<br>For in her music, love forever stays.
