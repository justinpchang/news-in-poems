In the land of stars and stripes so bold,<br>Foreign aid, the treasure they withhold.<br>From money to arms,<br>A pause causes alarms,<br>In the memo's news, its story is told.<br><br>No more help to lands afar,<br>From development aid to army car.<br>The State Department's call,<br>Makes diplomats stall,<br>In uncertainty they now are.<br><br>What will nations in need now do?<br>When the aid they rely on falls through.<br>A leaking memo's whisper,<br>Causing many to shiver,<br>In the world's diplomacy, a hullabaloo.
