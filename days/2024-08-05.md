In Paris, where the Seine river flows,<br>Belgian triathletes with Olympic dreams rose,<br>But alas, their teammate fell ill, a sorrowful blow,<br>From waters deemed unfit, they were forced to forego.<br><br>No practice swim in the murky Seine today,<br>A setback for the Belgian team's journey to play,<br>Olympic hopes dampened in a troubling way,<br>As poor water quality led them astray.<br><br>The triathletes must now seek a new stride,<br>In different waters, where purity may abide,<br>Despite this setback by the riverside,<br>Belgian resilience shall not be denied.
