In the city under siege, a radio station's plea,<br>Reporting local news with urgency and glee.<br>Fears and frustrations heard through the air,<br>As Ukrainian lives hang on with despair.<br><br>A real estate agent, amidst the chaos and strife,<br>Answers questions of hope for a new life.<br>State subsidies offered for blown-up homes,<br>But bureaucracy and paperwork weigh like stones.<br><br>Online theater shows, a glimmer of light,<br>An escape, a respite from the endless fight.<br>But one listener scoffs at this added feat,<br>"What additional format?" she asks, bitter and beat.<br><br>The government allotted space on the FM line,<br>For Radio Boiling Over, a voice so fine.<br>To counter the Russians, their warfare of mind,<br>With eerie content, meant to unnerve and bind.<br><br>"We will kill you," the phrase echoes through,<br>A sinister message, meant to subdue.<br>But Radio Boiling Over, their broadcast prevailed,<br>People tuned in, their fears unveiled.<br><br>For they are the source of swift and true news,<br>Of missile strikes and battles, the front's cruel hues.<br>A beacon of hope in a city under fire,<br>Radio Boiling Over will never tire.<br><br>In the face of darkness, they bring forth the light,<br>Giving voice to the voices, a fearless fight.<br>In this Ukrainian city, besieged and worn,<br>Radio Boiling Over, their resolve is reborn.<br><br>Through fears and frustrations, their stories unfold,<br>A testament of strength, resolute and bold.<br>In the heart of the siege, their voices ring clear,<br>Radio Boiling Over, their truth we hold dear.
