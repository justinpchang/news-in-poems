In California's embrace of sun and sea,<br>A tragedy by dawn's light we see,<br>A bear's intrusion to history's stage,<br>Leaving sorrow, loss, and rage.<br><br>Nature's fierce and wild play,<br>In someone's home, it found its way,<br>A woman lost to claw and tooth,<br>Leaving behind a community in sooth.<br><br>In forests deep or urban sprawl,<br>Nature's creatures heed no man's call,<br>A fatal tale that now resides,<br>In California's valleys and hillsides.
