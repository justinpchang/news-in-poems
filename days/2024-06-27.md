In Jenin, a raid took its toll,<br>An officer paid the ultimate toll.<br>With courage they'd fight,<br>In the dark of the night,<br>In West Bank, where tensions take their role.<br><br>But amidst the chaos and strife,<br>In the struggle for each side's life,<br>A soldier fell,<br>His story to tell,<br>In a land where peace battles with strife.<br><br>The IDF ventured into the fight,<br>In Jenin, where shadows take flight.<br>With one lost soul,<br>And another's role,<br>In a conflict that blinds with its light.<br><br>A Palestinian also bore the pain,<br>As violence poured like the rain.<br>In West Bank's embrace,<br>Where hope's a mere trace,<br>In a timeless cycle, stuck in disdain.
