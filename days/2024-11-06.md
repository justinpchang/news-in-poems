Oh, glorious stock markets, how they rise,<br>As Bitcoin soars beyond the skies.<br>Dollar's climb, futures up in glee,<br>A favor to Trump, can't you see?<br><br>Bulls and bears, in a fierce dance,<br>Numbers on screens, a risky romance.<br>Key states lean towards the past,<br>Trump's supporters holding fast.<br><br>In the realm of finance, a tale is told,<br>Of markets swaying, bold and cold.<br>Uncertainty in the trading game,<br>As Trump's return could ignite the flame.<br><br>So watch the tickers, follow the trends,<br>As politics and money blend.<br>Stock markets up in a jubilant cheer,<br>As key states lean, the future unclear.
