In the realm of aiding the mute, a tool was born,<br>Promising words to the voiceless forlorn,<br>But whispers now echo of a dark manipulation,<br>Accusations twist, stirring a false sensation.<br><br>A glimmer of hope in a technological land,<br>Designed to lend a voice, to understand,<br>Yet shadows lurk where light should have shone,<br>Unveiling a tale of deceit over truth sown.<br><br>Allegations dance like shadows in the night,<br>A tool once hailed now cloaked in blight,<br>Misguided intentions led to this grim twist,<br>Where trust erodes, lost in the mist.<br><br>Oh, tool of promise now tainted by doubt,<br>Once hailed a savior, now called out,<br>May truth prevail, shedding light on this deceit,<br>And restore faith in a tool meant to greet.
