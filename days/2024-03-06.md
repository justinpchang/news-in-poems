In Fritch, where disasters have shown,<br>From tornadoes to fires, they've known,<br>Mickey German's heart aches,<br>As another town breaks,<br>Yet in tough times, their strength is grown.<br><br>The Renegade witnessed the fight,<br>In '92, a storm's cruel might,<br>200 homes laid low,<br>Yet Fritch's spirits glow,<br>Resilience shines in the darkest night.<br><br>Mother's Day in 2014, a fire,<br>Took 225, their hopes grew dire,<br>Now in 2022,<br>A town once more blew,<br>But Fritch won't let their hope expire.<br><br>1.2 million acres ablaze,<br>In Texas, where the wildfire stays,<br>Mickey, homeless again,<br>Endures heartache and pain,<br>Yet in Fritch, hope forever stays.
