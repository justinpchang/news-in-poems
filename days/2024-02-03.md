Oh, Canada, a land of secrets untold,<br>Where public access and secrecy take hold.<br>A public inquiry seeks to shed some light,<br>On foreign meddling in our elections slight.<br><br>The Globe and Mail, a whistleblower's guide,<br>A tale of China's hand, they did confide.<br>Their diplomats, with cunning and finesse,<br>Ensured Trudeau's party would domineer, no less.<br><br>Seventeen articles, the truth revealed,<br>Yet the source remains hidden, yet unrevealed.<br>A risk of prison, a voice unheard,<br>For Chinese interference, a frustrating word.<br><br>But in this land, where openness is prized,<br>Secrecy stands tall, justice compromised.<br>Intelligence secure, the government's plea,<br>Leaving the inquiry in a web of mystery.<br><br>Oh, Canada, where silence reigns supreme,<br>The truth obscured, a haunting dream.<br>A delicate dance, balancing the scale,<br>Between public right and secrets veiled.<br><br>Let's pause and ponder, how did we arrive,<br>In a nation where transparency must survive?<br>Foreign election meddling, a topic so grave,<br>Yet obscured by secrecy, like waves on the wave.<br><br>But still, we yearn for the truth to emerge,<br>To shed light on the shadows, this inquiry's urge.<br>For in our land, justice should prevail,<br>And foreign interference, we must unveil.<br><br>Oh, Canada, may the truth come to light,<br>May secrets be revealed, no longer out of sight.<br>For in the balance of openness and secrecy,<br>Let justice reign, and set our nation free.
