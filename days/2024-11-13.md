Oh Nora Holt, a pioneer bold,<br>In Chicago's music scene, her story told,<br>A trailblazer in classical art,<br>With rhythm and soul that set her apart.<br><br>In the company of Josephine Baker she shone,<br>Her melodies, like jewels, beautifully sown,<br>From Chicago to Paris, her voice did soar,<br>A blues singer in nightclubs, forevermore.<br><br>In the echoes of jazz and classical rhyme,<br>Nora Holt danced through the sands of time,<br>Her legacy, a melody sweet and true,<br>A trailblazer in music, forever anew.
